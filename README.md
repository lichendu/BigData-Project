           This project is about using the TensorFlow training model and MNIST database to help users to recognize a certain digit number from a picture which contains a hand-writing number. The users can use the curl- X POST command to upload their test picture (which should be in 28px* 28px) to the localhost URL address. Then, the project will use Flask to handle the picture upload requests and will run the prediction for the digit number it contains. MNIST is a large database contains more than 60,000 training images. Applying TensorFlow to the model, users can receive high accuracy digital number outputs from their uploaded pictures.
