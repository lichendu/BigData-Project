## General Information and Motivation
Welcome! This MNIST project is completed with the instructions provided by Dr. Zhang Fan from MIT LIGO Lab. I learned the principle of the Tensoflow learning model and many uses of languages from Dr. Fanâ€™s lecture. Many of them are relating and necessary to the project, and others are widely used in the area of Big Data. Thus, As a beginner to this area, I designed this project to help users to recognize hand-writing numbers.

## Project Description
This project uses the TensorFlow training model and MNIST database to help users to recognize a single digit number (0-9) from a picture which contains a hand-writing number. The users can use the curl- X POST command to upload their test picture (which should be in 28px* 28px) to the localhost URL address. Then, the project will use Flask to handle the picture upload requests and will run the prediction for the digit number it contains. MNIST is a large database contains more than 60,000 training images. Applying TensorFlow to the model, users can receive high accuracy digital number outputs from their uploaded pictures. 


## Technologies
This project is created with the following: 
* Python               3.6  
* redis                3.3.8  
* numpy                1.16.5   
* Pillow               6.1.0  
* Flask                1.1.1  
* tensorflow           1.14.0 

## Set Up
To run this project, you should install the technologies above in the right version. And then pull the documents and ckpt file from GitHub. 

## Code Example
    def loadmodel(img_path=None, ckpt_dir="./ckpt"): # here need to specify the location of your ckpt folder
        if img_path is None:
            return 
            
        # 1. define a session
        sess = tf.Session()
        
        # 2. checkpoint dir
        ckpt_dir = ckpt_dir
        ckpt = tf.train.get_checkpoint_state(ckpt_dir)  
        print(ckpt)
        
        # 3. load
        if ckpt and ckpt.model_checkpoint_path:
            # 3.1 coumpute graph
            saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph(ckpt.model_checkpoint_path + ".meta", clear_devices=True)
            # 3.2 load weights
            saver.restore(sess, ckpt.model_checkpoint_path) 

        # 4. load input and label tensor
        x_op = sess.graph.get_tensor_by_name("Placeholder:0")
        predict_op = sess.graph.get_tensor_by_name("Softmax:0")

        # 5. read inputs
        img = Image.open(img_path).convert('L')     
        flatten_img = np.reshape(img, 784)
        x = np.array([1 - flatten_img])

        # 6. prediction
        y = sess.run(predict_op, feed_dict={x_op: x})
        result = np.argmax(y[0])
        
        return result



## Prediction 
Notice: The picture should contain a single digit number and be in 28px*28px. You can either draw a hand-writing number in a picture or use the testing pictures called "test1.png" and "test2.png".
Then, Use the following curl command to upload picture. subsitute the [filename] with the name of your picture or the name of test picture. 

       curl -F "file=@[filename]" localhost:5000/upload

As the result, you will have a output which is a digit number from 0-9.
